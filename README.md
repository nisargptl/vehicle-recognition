<h1>IRIS vehicle recognition software</h1>

<h4>This enables users to gather information about any vehicle and they can see the details in a matter of seconds.
Snap a quick photo in the app and it will provide the details about the vehicle make, model,
year, user ratings and starting retail price. In addition, it will provide this same information for
the 2 closest competitors so a user can do some quick comparison shopping.</h4>
